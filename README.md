This repository contains the code and thesis for my bachelor project in physics.

The focus of the project is the thermodynamic behaviour and the phase transition
of the 3-state Potts model (a generalization of the Ising model). The partition
function of this system can not be exactly determined. Therefore numerical
approaches using Monte Carlo methods are employed.
